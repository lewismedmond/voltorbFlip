# voltorbFlip
Voltorb Flip is a minigame similar to minesweeper taken from the Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal games. It's played on a 5x5 grid of hidden tiles consisting of numbers (which score you points when turned) and 'voltorbs' which lose you the game when turned. In addition to the 5x5 grid, you are given a key for each column and row telling you two things: how many voltorbs are in the row/column and the sum of all the numbers in the row/column. This is all the information the player is provided with. To 'win', the player must turn over all number tiles greater than 1 without turning over any voltorbs. The score the player receives is then calculated to be the product of all numbers on the board (thus why the 1's can be ignored). 
In this project, I aim to effectively simulate the voltorb flip minigame and train a program to play this game 'perfectly' through the use of machine learning.
